    "## Question 1: Down payment calculation program (15 Marks)\n",

    "Write a program to calculate and return how many months it will take you to save up enough money for the down payment required. Given the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name the cost of your dream home **total_cost**. \n",
    "2. Assume your annual salary is **annual_salary**. \n",
    "3. Name the percent of the cost needed for a down payment **percent_down_payment**. For simplicity, assume that percent_down_payment is 25%. \n",
    "4. You are going to dedicate a certain percent of your salary each month to saving for the down payment. Name that **percent_savings**. This variable should be in decimal form (eg. 0.1 for 10%).  \n",
    "5. You will also invest the above savings with an annual return of r (in other words, at the end of each month, you receive **monthly_returns** = current_savings*(r/12) of investment returns back. \n",
    "Assume that your investments earn an annual return **r of  4%**. And to keep things simple, it will not be compounded.\n",
